A barebones dirt simple basic caption editor for editing blip captions.

1. Select a folder with matching .png and .txt file names (image.png, image.txt)
2. Use Next/Previous button to browse images. Shortcut key: Alt+left/right arrow keys
3. Edit text as appropriate
4. Text will save when navigating to the text or previous image.

Mostly chatgpt, only minor adjustments.
